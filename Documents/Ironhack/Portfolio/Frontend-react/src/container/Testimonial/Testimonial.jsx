          Hi, it's Jillian. I am a Mexican ingenious Web Dev & Designer. First of all, thank you for reading my Portfolio, it's such a pleasure to have you here!

          A couple of words about my professional life:  After obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Digital Design, I gained experience in a wide range of design disciplines from startups based in MÃ¡laga, where I used Adobe Creative Suite software intensively during both my professional life and spare time. For a few years for me, the idea of assembling Web Development with Digital Design was exciting, a path that would make me be capable of shaping all kinds of unspoken desires, which eventually led me to study Computer Software Engineering Bootcamp at Ironhack.
